    <p>There was once a young man named <em>Jack</em>, who went to uni for a bacelor's in <strong>CS</strong>.<br />
	His family spends plenty of money on this utter <em>slack</em>, while he studies less and less.<br />
	His grades inevitably begin to fall off <em>track</em>, turning his life into a mess.<br />
	His intelligence was lauded a year or two <em>back</em>, now he starts to think it was <ins>BS</ins>.<br />
